# Skyl'Art

This is a team project we did during the web development bootcamp at Skylab Coders Academy. We created a Digital Art Gallery with ReactJS and we used the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/).\
The application will allow the user to view six different art categories. The user will be able to see all the artworks in the selected category as well as the detailed information of each one. When logging in, the user will have a Favorites section where they can add or remove their favorite artworks.
